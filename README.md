<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
# About C50W final project - Cswebfunding

Cswebfunding is a site where you can support other people's dreams or have your own dream realised.  
The idea comes from a kickstarter-like website, but with my own touch and execution.

### Built With

- Python
  * [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/)
  * [django-notifications-hq](https://pypi.org/project/django-notifications-hq/)
- Javascript
- HTML & CSS
  * [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)

### Distinctiveness and Complexity
In Cswebfunding you can create listings, donate and comment to listings and much more. You can also search for listings and view other peoples profiles.
I have also tried my best to make this a 'fun' site by adding various animations.

The project was built using Django as a backend framework and JavaScript as a frontend programming language. All generated information are saved in a SQLite Database.
All webpages of the project are mobile-responsive.

(note. If you interpret this as a social network. I have asked this in the CS5O discord to be sure, and they reassured me it's not!)
