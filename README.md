<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
# About C50W final project - Cswebfunding

Cswebfunding is a site where you can support other people's dreams or have your own dream realised.  
The idea comes from a kickstarter-like website, but with my own touch and execution.

### Built With

- Python
  * [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/)
  * [django-notifications-hq](https://pypi.org/project/django-notifications-hq/)
- Javascript
- HTML & CSS
  * [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)

### Distinctiveness and Complexity
(note. If you interpret this as a social network. It is not, and I have asked this in the cs5O discord to be sure!)
I have spent about a month going through different designs and ideas to work out this website.
